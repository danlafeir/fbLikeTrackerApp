fbLikeTrackerApp
================

This is something I built to dynamically create a table of likes from different facebook pages

The tracker app is in one folder and the other is a dummy sails application I used for persistent storage. 
That could easily be created by using the sailsjs library

I am hoping to add a search functionality to it so you don't need to know what page url is. 

I made this to practice with the FB api and angularjs (I highly reccomend angularjs)
